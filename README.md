## 👨‍💻 About Me

- I’m interested in how learning, optimization, and complex behaviours emerge from simple rules.  
- I recently completed my thesis at **AstraZeneca**, working on **Quality-Diversity Reinforcement Learning** for molecular design using multi-agent RL, generative models, diversity metrics, and GPU-based experiments.  
- I enjoy breaking down difficult problems, running structured experiments, and understanding models beyond surface-level results.  
- Before moving into ML, I worked as a **Mechanical Design Engineer at KONE**, which shaped how I approach engineering: systematic thinking, attention to detail, and practical decision-making.  
- I'm comfortable with **PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, RL algorithms, evolutionary methods**, and reproducible ML workflows.  
- I’m especially interested in **reinforcement learning, optimization, generative models**, and computational science.  
- Outside academics, I enjoy **badminton, cooking**, and participating in community/volunteer activities.
